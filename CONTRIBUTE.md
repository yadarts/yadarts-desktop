## Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes. 

* Before you start working on a new feature, create a new issue to start a discussion on it.
* We follow the fork & pull development model: <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>
* Follow the OSS code guidelines:
 * Agile development with Scrum
 * TDD with all tests following the [F.I.R.S.T.](http://agileinaflash.blogspot.de/2009/02/first.html) principles: fast, isolates, repeatable, self-validating, timely.
  * Unit tests for day-to-day developments
  * Before accepting pull requests into the main repository, integration tests have to run successfully 

Don't get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the maintainers is around 3 days.

# Bug triage

You can help report bugs by filing them here: <https://github.com/yadarts/yadarts-desktop/issues>

* Don't forget to check the existing ones first
* Look at existing bugs and help us understand if the bug is reproducible. Is it reproducible in other environments (OS, JVM, application servers)? What are the steps to reproduce? 

# Documentation

If you have developed a new feature (see [Adding new features](#adding-new-features)), create
a documentation draft in the corresponding issue. We decide how to
include it into the overall project documentation.
